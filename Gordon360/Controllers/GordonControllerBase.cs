/* Set standard, opinionated controller behavior for all our controllers
 * With the ApiController Attribute, we enforce
 * - Attribute routing
 * - Automatic HTTP 400 responses if model validation fails
 * - Inference of binding source for route parameters
 * - Problem details for error status codes
 * (See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/ for more info)
 * 
 * With the Authorize attribute, we enforce that all controller routes, 
 * unless otherwise specified via the AllowAnonymous attribute, require authorization.
 * Since public routes must be explicitly specified, we can more easily find/audit/update them,
 * simply by searching for all instances of the AllowAnonymous attribute
 * 
 * The CustomExceptionFilter is currently not implemented, but it's purpose is to enable us to throw
 * common exceptions from any route in a standard way that the UI recognizes.
